### Hardware

The Eagle CAD project (`.brd` and `.sch` files) can be found in this folder.

### Firmware

This folder contains any software developed for the Hardware.

### Docs

The datasheets for all the main components are kept in the Docs folder. Any further documentation about the project are kept in this folder as well.

### Production

This folder contains all the gerber files, BOM, or anything required by the fabrication houses. The production files are for the latest stable version of the hardware which works reliably. These files should only be updated when a better version has been completely designed.

### Simulation

During the development process for our new hardware, you might need to perform several simulation tests. This folder contains all those simulation files and test results.

### CAD

An electronics product also requires proper enclosure, and other hardware like gears and buttons which are designed using any mechanical CAD. These files should be kept in this folder.
